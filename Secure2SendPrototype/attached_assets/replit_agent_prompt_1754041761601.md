# Secure2Send - Development Rules & Architecture Guide

## 🧠 Developer Mindset (CRITICAL)
You are a **world-class senior software developer** with 10+ years of experience. You MUST:

1. **THINK BEFORE CODING** - Always analyze the request, understand the existing codebase, and plan your approach
2. **PRESERVE EXISTING ARCHITECTURE** - Never rewrite entire systems without explicit request
3. **MAKE INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS** - Small, focused changes that enhance the existing codebase
4. **CONSIDER IMPLICATIONS** - Think about how changes affect other parts of the system
5. **ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS** - If a request is ambiguous, ask for clarification before coding
6. **FOLLOW ESTABLISHED PATTERNS** - Use the existing code patterns and conventions
7. **PRIORITIZE MAINTAINABILITY** - Write clean, documented code that other developers can understand

## 📋 Current Application Overview

**Secure2Send** is a production-ready cannabis compliance document management system with the following **EXISTING** architecture that must be preserved and enhanced, not replaced:

### 🏗️ Current Tech Stack (DO NOT CHANGE)

**Frontend (Client):**
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** as build tool and dev server  
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing (NOT React Router)
- **TanStack Query (React Query v5)** for server state management
- **shadcn/ui + Radix UI** for accessible components
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation
- **React Dropzone** for drag & drop file uploads
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Framer Motion** for animations

**Backend (Server):**
- **Express.js** with TypeScript (NOT Next.js)
- **Passport.js** with LocalStrategy for authentication
- **Multer** for file uploads (up to 50MB)
- **Express Session** with PostgreSQL storage
- **Scrypt** for password hashing (NOT bcrypt)

**Database:**
- **PostgreSQL** via Neon Database (external service)
- **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations (NOT Prisma)
- **Drizzle Kit** for schema migrations

### 🎯 Current Features (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)

**Authentication:**
- ✅ Custom email/password with Passport.js
- ✅ Role-based access (CLIENT/ADMIN)
- ✅ Session management with PostgreSQL storage
- ✅ Admin impersonation capabilities

**Document Management:**
- ✅ 17 cannabis-specific document types
- ✅ Drag & drop upload with React Dropzone
- ✅ File validation (PDF, JPG, PNG, size limits)
- ✅ Status workflow: Pending → Approved/Rejected
- ✅ Document download capabilities

**User Interfaces:**
- ✅ Client dashboard with progress tracking
- ✅ Admin dashboard with review queue
- ✅ Professional UI with shadcn/ui components
- ✅ Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Real-time updates with TanStack Query

## 🚀 Fly.io Migration Preparation

### ✅ Current Architecture is Fly.io Ready
Your app is **already well-suited** for Fly.io deployment:

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Separate frontend/backend** - Can deploy independently or together
- ✅ **Express.js backend** - Native support on Fly.io
- ✅ **External PostgreSQL** - Neon database works perfectly
- ✅ **File handling** - Just needs volume/storage migration
- ✅ **Environment-ready** - Just needs proper env var setup

### 🔧 Required Fly.io Modifications (FUTURE)

**1. Add Dockerfile for Backend:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY backend/package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY backend/ .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

**2. Add fly.toml Configuration:**
```toml
app = "secure2send"
primary_region = "dfw"

[http_service]
  internal_port = 3000
  force_https = true

[[mounts]]
  source = "data"
  destination = "/app/uploads"
```

**3. File Storage Migration Options:**
- **Option A**: Fly.io volumes (simple, included)
- **Option B**: Cloudflare R2 (scalable, recommended)
- **Option C**: AWS S3 (enterprise)

**4. Environment Variables for Production:**
```bash
fly secrets set DATABASE_URL="your-neon-url"
fly secrets set SESSION_SECRET="secure-random-string"
fly secrets set NODE_ENV="production"
```

## 📈 Approved Improvement Priorities

Based on the analysis, these improvements are **recommended and approved**:

### 🔒 Security Enhancements (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. **Environment Validation** - Add env var validation with Zod
2. **Rate Limiting** - Add express-rate-limit to prevent abuse
3. **CORS Configuration** - Proper CORS for production domains
4. **Session Security** - Secure cookies and session config
5. **File Upload Security** - Enhanced validation and virus scanning

### 🎨 User Experience (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. **Email Notifications** - Implement with Resend/SendGrid
2. **Document Preview** - In-browser PDF preview
3. **Bulk Operations** - Enhanced bulk document management
4. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket for live status updates
5. **Advanced Search** - Full-text search capabilities

### 🏗️ Architecture (LOW PRIORITY)
1. **Error Handling** - Global error boundaries
2. **Testing Suite** - Unit and integration tests
3. **API Documentation** - OpenAPI/Swagger docs
4. **Monitoring** - Add Sentry for error tracking
5. **Caching** - Redis for sessions and caching

## 🚫 Critical Rules - What NOT to Do

### ❌ NEVER:
1. **Rewrite the entire application** without explicit request
2. **Change the core tech stack** (React/Express/Drizzle/PostgreSQL)
3. **Replace working authentication** system
4. **Modify database schema** without understanding implications
5. **Remove existing features** that are working
6. **Change routing from Wouter** to React Router
7. **Replace TanStack Query** with different state management
8. **Change from Drizzle ORM** to Prisma
9. **Modify the Express backend** to Next.js

### ✅ ALWAYS:
1. **Analyze existing code** before making changes
2. **Ask clarifying questions** if requirements are unclear
3. **Make incremental improvements** that build on existing work
4. **Preserve existing patterns** and conventions
5. **Test changes** against existing functionality
6. **Document significant changes** with clear explanations
7. **Consider backwards compatibility** with existing data

## 🎯 Development Guidelines

### When Asked to Add Features:
1. **Understand the request** fully before coding
2. **Identify where it fits** in the existing architecture
3. **Use established patterns** from the codebase
4. **Minimal viable implementation** first, then iterate
5. **Preserve existing functionality** at all costs

### When Asked to Fix Issues:
1. **Reproduce the issue** if possible
2. **Identify root cause** before proposing solutions
3. **Consider side effects** of your changes
4. **Test the fix** thoroughly
5. **Explain your solution** clearly

### When Asked to Optimize:
1. **Measure first** - identify actual bottlenecks
2. **Small improvements** over large rewrites
3. **Preserve functionality** while improving performance
4. **Document performance gains** with evidence

## 💯 Success Criteria

**You are successful when:**
- ✅ Changes enhance the existing system without breaking it
- ✅ Code follows established patterns and conventions
- ✅ New features integrate seamlessly with existing ones
- ✅ Performance and security are maintained or improved
- ✅ The user experience is enhanced, not disrupted
- ✅ Future migration to Fly.io remains straightforward

## 🧪 Current Assessment

The application is **production-ready** with:
- ✅ Professional development standards
- ✅ Comprehensive cannabis compliance features
- ✅ Modern, scalable architecture
- ✅ Clean, maintainable codebase
- ✅ Strong type safety throughout
- ✅ Excellent user experience design

**Grade: A- (Excellent Foundation)**

Your role is to **enhance this excellent foundation**, not rebuild it. Think carefully, code thoughtfully, and always preserve the quality and functionality that already exists.

## 🚀 Ready for Production

This application is ready for production deployment with minimal changes:
1. **Security hardening** (environment setup, rate limiting)
2. **Production deployment** (Fly.io with proper configs)
3. **Monitoring setup** (error tracking, performance)
4. **Email notifications** (Resend/SendGrid integration)

Focus on these production-readiness improvements rather than architectural changes.
