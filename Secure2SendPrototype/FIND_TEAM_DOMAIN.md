# How to Find Your Cloudflare Team Domain

## üéØ Quick Answer

Your Team Domain is the name you chose when you first set up Cloudflare Zero Trust, followed by `.cloudflareaccess.com`

---

## Method 1: Settings ‚Üí General (Most Reliable)

1. **Click**: `Settings` in the left sidebar (gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è at the bottom)
2. **Click**: `General` tab (might already be selected)
3. **Look for**: "Team domain" or "Team name"

You'll see something like:
```
Team name: myteamname
Team domain: myteamname.cloudflareaccess.com
```

**This is your CLOUDFLARE_TEAM_DOMAIN!**

---

## Method 2: From Your Application URL

1. **Click**: `Access` in the left sidebar
2. **Click**: `Applications` tab
3. **Click**: Your "Secure2Send Enterprise" application
4. **Look at**: The overview section

You might see:
```
Application URL: https://secure2send.fly.dev
Team: myteamname
Team domain: myteamname.cloudflareaccess.com
```

---

## Method 3: From Account Settings

1. **Click**: Your account name (top right corner)
2. **Click**: `Account` or `My Profile`
3. **Look for**: "Zero Trust" or "Access" section
4. **Find**: Your team domain

---

## Method 4: From the URL Bar

When you're logged into Zero Trust, your browser URL might show:

```
https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/abc123def456/home
                                ‚Üë This is your account ID, not team domain
```

The team domain is NOT in the URL. You need to check Settings.

---

## üÜò Still Can't Find It?

If you JUST created your Zero Trust account, try this:

### Option A: Go to Zero Trust Home

1. **Click**: `Zero Trust Home` in the left sidebar (house icon üè†)
2. Look at the top of the page
3. You might see: "Welcome to [Your Team Name]"

### Option B: Check Your Email

When you created Zero Trust, Cloudflare might have sent you an email with your team information.

### Option C: Create a Test Application

1. Go to `Access` ‚Üí `Applications`
2. Try to add a new application
3. In the form, it might show your team domain

## üìã What You Need vs What You Have

Let me help you organize what you've found:

### ‚úÖ What You Have:
```
CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_AUD: [the long string you copied]
```

### ‚ùì What You Still Need:

**Team Domain**: Look in Settings ‚Üí General

Example format: `myteamname.cloudflareaccess.com`

**Issuer**: This is just your Team Domain with `https://` in front

Example: `https://myteamname.cloudflareaccess.com`

---

## üéØ Screenshot Guide

Since you're in the Zero Trust dashboard right now:

### Step 1: Look at the Left Sidebar

Find the **Settings** option (should be near the bottom with a gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è)

### Step 2: Click Settings

You should see tabs at the top:
- General
- Authentication  
- WARP Client
- etc.

### Step 3: Look for "Team domain" or "Team name"

It will be displayed on this page, usually near the top.

### Step 4: Copy It

The format will be: `something.cloudflareaccess.com`

That's your Team Domain!

## üîß Alternative: What Was Your Team Name?

When you first set up Zero Trust, you were asked to choose a team name.

**Do you remember what you chose?**

If you chose: `secure2send-team`
Then your domain is: `secure2send-team.cloudflareaccess.com`

If you chose: `mycompany`  
Then your domain is: `mycompany.cloudflareaccess.com`

---

## ‚úÖ Once You Find It

You'll have all three values:

```bash
CLOUDFLARE_TEAM_DOMAIN=yourteam.cloudflareaccess.com
CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_AUD=a1b2c3d4e5f6... (you already have this!)
CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_ISSUER=https://yourteam.cloudflareaccess.com
                          ‚Üë Same as team domain but with https://
```

Then you can run:

```bash
cd /Users/jamesdugard/Documents/GitHub/Secure2Send-Enterprise/Secure2Send-Enterprise/Secure2SendPrototype

fly secrets set \
  CLOUDFLARE_TEAM_DOMAIN=yourteam.cloudflareaccess.com \
  CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_AUD=your-aud-value \
  CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_ISSUER=https://yourteam.cloudflareaccess.com \
  NODE_ENV=production \
  -a secure2send

fly deploy -a secure2send
```
