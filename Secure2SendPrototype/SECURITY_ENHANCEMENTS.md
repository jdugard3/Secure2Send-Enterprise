# Secure2Send Enterprise Security & Compliance Enhancements

## üéØ Overview

This document outlines the enterprise-grade security and compliance features that have been implemented to transform Secure2Send into a SOC 2 compliant platform for business document management.

## üîí Security Features Implemented

### 1. Cloudflare R2 Integration
- **Secure File Storage**: All documents are now stored in Cloudflare R2 with server-side encryption (AES-256)
- **Signed URLs**: Temporary, secure download links that expire after 1 hour
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful fallback to local storage if R2 is unavailable
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Local files are removed after successful R2 upload

### 2. Field-Level Encryption
- **Sensitive Data Protection**: SSN, banking information, and tax IDs are encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- **Key Derivation**: Uses SCRYPT with per-record salts for maximum security
- **Separate Storage**: Sensitive data stored in dedicated `sensitive_data` table
- **Audit Trail**: All access to sensitive data is logged

### 3. Comprehensive Audit Logging
- **Complete Activity Tracking**: Every user action is logged with full context
- **Compliance Ready**: Audit logs include IP addresses, user agents, and timestamps
- **Resource Tracking**: Links actions to specific documents, clients, or users
- **Admin Oversight**: Special logging for admin actions and impersonation

### 4. Enhanced Security Headers
- **Helmet.js Integration**: Comprehensive HTTP security headers
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP to prevent XSS attacks
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security with preload
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured cross-origin resource sharing

### 5. Database Security Enhancements
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Proper referential integrity with CASCADE deletes
- **Indexes**: Performance-optimized indexes for audit queries
- **Comments**: Full documentation of security-related columns
- **Migration Scripts**: Versioned database changes for audit trail

## üìä SOC 2 Compliance Features

### Access Controls (CC6.1 - CC6.3)
- ‚úÖ **Role-based Access Control**: Admin/Client role separation
- ‚úÖ **Session Management**: Secure session handling with proper timeouts
- ‚úÖ **Admin Impersonation**: Audited admin access to client accounts
- ‚úÖ **File Access Control**: Document access restricted to owners and admins

### Audit Logging (CC7.1 - CC7.5)
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Logging**: All user actions tracked
- ‚úÖ **Tamper Resistance**: Audit logs in separate, append-only table
- ‚úÖ **Log Retention**: Timestamped logs for compliance reporting
- ‚úÖ **Activity Monitoring**: Real-time audit trail for security events

### Data Encryption (CC6.7)
- ‚úÖ **Data at Rest**: Files encrypted in Cloudflare R2
- ‚úÖ **Field-Level Encryption**: Sensitive PII encrypted in database
- ‚úÖ **Data in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- ‚úÖ **Key Management**: Proper key derivation and storage

### Data Processing (CC8.1)
- ‚úÖ **Data Classification**: Sensitive data identified and protected
- ‚úÖ **Data Retention**: Audit logs for data lifecycle management
- ‚úÖ **Secure Deletion**: Proper cleanup of files from both R2 and local storage
- ‚úÖ **Data Integrity**: Checksums and validation for uploaded files

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### New Database Tables

#### `sensitive_data`
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- user_id (Foreign Key to users)
- client_id (Foreign Key to clients)
- ssn (Encrypted Text)
- bank_account_number (Encrypted Text)
- routing_number (Encrypted Text)
- tax_id (Encrypted Text)
- encrypted_at (Timestamp)
- last_accessed (Timestamp)
```

#### `audit_logs`
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- user_id (Foreign Key to users)
- action (Enum: LOGIN, LOGOUT, DOCUMENT_UPLOAD, etc.)
- resource_type (VARCHAR: 'document', 'client', 'user')
- resource_id (VARCHAR: ID of affected resource)
- details (JSONB: Additional context)
- ip_address (VARCHAR)
- user_agent (TEXT)
- timestamp (Timestamp)
```

#### Enhanced `documents` table
```sql
+ r2_key (TEXT: Cloudflare R2 object key)
+ r2_url (TEXT: Public URL if needed)
+ encryption_key_id (VARCHAR: For future key rotation)
```

### New Services

#### `CloudflareR2Service`
- File upload with server-side encryption
- Signed URL generation for secure downloads
- File deletion and cleanup
- Error handling and fallback support

#### `EncryptionService`
- AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive fields
- SCRYPT key derivation with salts
- Batch encryption/decryption operations
- Encryption detection utilities

#### `AuditService`
- Centralized audit logging
- Specialized methods for different event types
- IP address and user agent capture
- Query methods for compliance reporting

## üîß Environment Configuration

Required environment variables for full security features:

```bash
# Cloudflare R2
CLOUDFLARE_R2_ENDPOINT=https://your-account-id.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET_NAME=secure2send-documents
CLOUDFLARE_R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-bucket.domain.com

# Strong session secret for encryption key derivation
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secure-32-character-minimum-secret
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Functional Testing
- [ ] File upload to R2 working
- [ ] File download via signed URLs working
- [ ] Local storage fallback working
- [ ] File deletion from both R2 and local storage
- [ ] Audit logs created for all actions

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Pre-deployment
1. Set up Cloudflare R2 bucket and credentials
2. Configure strong SESSION_SECRET (32+ characters)
3. Run database migrations
4. Test all security features in staging

### Post-deployment
1. Verify security headers are active
2. Test file upload/download flows
3. Confirm audit logging is working
4. Validate encrypted data in database
5. Test admin impersonation flows

## üìà Next Steps: Vanta Integration

With these security enhancements in place, the application is ready for:
- Vanta automated compliance monitoring
- SOC 2 Type I and Type II audits
- Additional compliance frameworks (HIPAA, etc.)
- Security questionnaire automation
- Continuous compliance monitoring

## üîç Monitoring & Alerting

Consider implementing:
- Failed login attempt monitoring
- Unusual file access pattern detection
- Audit log anomaly detection
- R2 storage usage monitoring
- Encryption/decryption error alerting
