# IRIS E-Signature Integration - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

This document summarizes the completed IRIS e-signature integration for merchant applications.

---

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema ‚úÖ
**File:** `migrations/011_add_esignature_tracking.sql`

Added e-signature tracking fields to `merchant_applications` table:
- `e_signature_status` - Status enum ('NOT_SENT', 'PENDING', 'SIGNED', 'DECLINED', 'EXPIRED')
- `e_signature_application_id` - IRIS e-signature application ID
- `e_signature_sent_at` - Timestamp when sent
- `e_signature_completed_at` - Timestamp when signed
- `signed_document_id` - Reference to signed document

**Indexes added:**
- Fast lookup by e-signature application ID
- Efficient tracking of pending signatures

### 2. PDF Generation Service ‚úÖ
**File:** `server/services/pdfFillService.ts`

Complete PDF form filling service that:
- Loads the Corduro MSA PDF template
- Programmatically fills all 257 form fields
- Maps merchant application data to PDF fields
- Handles principal officers, equipment, banking info
- Formats dates and phone numbers properly
- Saves temporary PDFs for IRIS upload
- Includes cleanup methods

**Test Script:** `scripts/test-pdf-fill.ts`
- Successfully generates filled PDFs
- Output tested at: `test-output/filled-application-test-*.pdf`

### 3. IRIS E-Signature API Methods ‚úÖ
**File:** `server/services/irisCrmService.ts`

Added four new methods:
1. **`generateESignatureDocument()`**
   - Uploads PDF to IRIS e-signature system
   - POST to `/leads/{leadId}/signatures/{applicationId}/generate`

2. **`sendESignatureDocument()`**
   - Sends email to merchant for signing
   - POST to `/leads/{leadId}/signatures/{applicationId}/send`

3. **`getESignatureStatus()`**
   - Checks current signature status
   - GET from `/leads/signatures/{applicationId}/status`

4. **`downloadSignedDocument()`**
   - Downloads completed signed PDF
   - GET from `/leads/signatures/{applicationId}/download`

### 4. Storage Methods ‚úÖ
**File:** `server/storage.ts`

Added two new storage methods:
1. **`updateMerchantApplicationESignature()`**
   - Updates e-signature status and metadata
   - Flexible partial updates

2. **`getMerchantApplicationByESignatureId()`**
   - Looks up applications by IRIS e-signature ID
   - Enables webhook processing (future enhancement)

### 5. Backend API Routes ‚úÖ
**File:** `server/routes.ts`

Three new endpoints:

#### POST `/api/merchant-applications/:id/send-for-signature`
- **Auth:** Admin only
- **Requirements:**
  - Application must be APPROVED
  - Must have IRIS lead ID
  - Cannot be already pending or signed
- **Process:**
  1. Validates application status
  2. Fills PDF with application data
  3. Uploads to IRIS e-signature system
  4. Sends email to merchant
  5. Updates status to PENDING
  6. Creates audit log

#### GET `/api/merchant-applications/:id/signature-status`
- **Auth:** Admin + Client (own applications)
- **Features:**
  - Returns current e-signature status
  - Polls IRIS for updates if PENDING
  - Auto-updates local status when changed
  - Includes sent/completed timestamps

#### POST `/api/merchant-applications/:id/download-signed-document`
- **Auth:** Admin only
- **Process:**
  1. Verifies document is signed
  2. Downloads PDF from IRIS
  3. Creates document record
  4. Links to merchant application
  5. Marks as APPROVED
  6. Creates audit log

### 6. Frontend Admin UI ‚úÖ
**File:** `client/src/components/admin/merchant-applications-list.tsx`

Enhanced with e-signature functionality:

#### New Features:
- **E-Signature Status Badge**
  - NOT_SENT (gray)
  - PENDING (blue, animated pulse)
  - SIGNED (green)
  - DECLINED (red)
  - EXPIRED (orange)

- **"Send for E-Signature" Button**
  - Appears for APPROVED applications
  - Only shows when status is NOT_SENT
  - Disables during processing
  - Shows success/error toasts

- **Status Information Cards**
  - Pending: Shows time since sent
  - Signed: Shows completion time
  - Color-coded visual feedback

## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

1. **PDF Field Names** - Some field names have slight inconsistencies (e.g., "City3" vs "City_3")
   - Non-critical, handled gracefully with warnings
   
2. **Manual Status Polling** - Status must be checked manually by viewing application
   - Recommendation: Implement webhooks for real-time updates

3. **No Client UI** - Clients cannot see e-signature status in their dashboard yet
   - Planned for future update

---

## üìû Support

### If Issues Occur:

1. **Check Logs:**
   ```bash
   # Server logs will show detailed e-signature flow
   grep "E-signature" server.log
   ```

2. **Verify IRIS Credentials:**
   ```bash
   # Test IRIS API connection
   curl -H "X-API-KEY: $IRIS_CRM_API_KEY" \
     https://iris.corduro.com/api/v1/leads
   ```

3. **Check Database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, e_signature_status, e_signature_sent_at 
   FROM merchant_applications 
   WHERE e_signature_status != 'NOT_SENT';
   ```
